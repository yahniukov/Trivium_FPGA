# Trivium_FPGA

The Xilinx FPGA Implementation of Trivium stream cipher. 

Was written using VHDL-2008 in Vivado.

The 'Design Sources' folder contains RTL architecture of Trivium cipher.

The 'Simulation Sources' folder contains two testbenches: 1) encipher test; 2) decipher test. Each testbench's folder contains waveform configuration.
